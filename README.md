# How to prefix a WordPress plugin

**Hello Prefixed World** plugin for WordPress. A plugin to showcase the PHP-Prefixer service.

Itâ€™s super quick to get a [PHP-Prefixer](https://php-prefixer.com/) project up and running. Install any library freely. PHP-Prefixer will manage your namespaces.

- **Use the same libraries across all platforms**: Develop your solutions using the same libraries for all the platforms you work in, specifically WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Laravel, Symfony, Slim Framework, etc.
- **Composer + WordPress**: Use Composer for your WordPress projects. PHP-Prefixer will process the dependencies to run smoothly along with other third-party plug-ins.
- **Fully integrated with Git**: Declare your name space configuration and let the service produce the packages. No local installation. No Phars. No new dependencies.
